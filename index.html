    <h4>When she was just a girl, she expected the world
        But it flew away from her reach
        So she ran away in her sleep and dreamed of
        Para-para-paradise, para-para-paradise, para-para-paradise
        Every time she closed her eyes
        When she was just a girl, she expected the world
        But it flew away from her reach and the bullets catch in her teeth
        Life goes on, it gets so heavy
        The wheel breaks the butterfly, every tear a waterfall
        In the night, the stormy night, she'd close her eyes
        In the night, the stormy night, away she'd fly
        And dream of para-para-paradise
        Para-para-paradise
        Para-para-paradise
        She'd dream of para-para-paradise
        Para-para-paradise
        Para-para-paradise</h4>
